<h1>Project on Console</h1>
<p>Write about visual studios and how to set it up</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
    Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on the microsoft/vscode repository of GitHub using the "Code â€“ OSS" name, under the permissive MIT License, while the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.</p>
<p>Write about the console screen. And why it's used.
And how to open the console screen and how to print anything on console</p>
<p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.</p>
